  TSM, the premier championship e-sports organization, is extremely excited to announce that VALORANT player "crappyjettmain" will be competing in the upcoming ULA Student Rocket Launch Tournament. An incredibly talented player, crappyjettmain reached Bronze I with an overall KDA of 0.420 in his first year of the game. Forged in the fires of Science Bowl and Science Research Club, his vocal presence and leadership qualities will no doubt prove to be an invaluable asset to the team as they prepare for upcoming competitions.
